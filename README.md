This is another practice data analysis, I found a cool dataset of some overwatch pro players mouse and hero settings so I decided to have somne fun with it and practice.
I'm not really an overwatch player(I've played a few times but not consistantly) however for much of the speculation of the game I consulted a friend of mine who is a masters
ranked overwatch player.
I hope you enjoy and any criticism is very much encouraged and appreciated as I am still learning
